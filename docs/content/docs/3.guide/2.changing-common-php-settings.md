# Changing common PHP settings
::lead-p
Instead of going through the effort of writing custom scripts or mounting files to change PHP settings, have the power to change common settings with the simplicity of an environment variable.
::

## Common Examples
All our environment variables are documented and can be found in our [environment variable specification](/docs/reference/environment-variable-specification) documentation.

Here are a few examples on how you can change common PHP settings. 

::code-panel
---
label: "Docker Compose: Changing allowed upload size"
---
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  php:
    image: serversideup/php:8.2.12-unit-bookworm
    environment:
      PHP_POST_MAX_SIZE: "500M"
      PHP_UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE: "500M"
      SSL_MODE: "mixed"
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/html/
```

::code-panel
---
label: "Docker CLI: Setting the PHP timezone to New York"
---
```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 80:80 \
  -v $(pwd):/var/www/html \
  -e PHP_DATE_TIMEZONE="America/New_York" \
  serversideup/php:8.2.12-fpm-nginx-bookworm
```

## Setting your own php.ini

::note
We're still working on documenting this section. Thanks for your patience. [Open a discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php/discussions/new?category=general) if you'd like to see this added sooner.

## Validating changes
It's always best to validate your changes by running `php -i` via the command line or using [`phpinfo()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.phpinfo.php).
